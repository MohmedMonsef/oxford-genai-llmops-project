Recently, LLMs have been shown to encode a\ntremendous amount of knowledge about the world and to perform impressive\nin-context learning and reasoning. However, using LLMs to solve real world\nproblems is hard because they are not grounded in the current task. In this\npaper we exploit the planning capabilities of LLMs while using RL to provide\nlearning from the environment, resulting in a hierarchical agent that uses LLMs\nto solve long-horizon tasks. Instead of completely relying on LLMs, they guide\na high-level policy, making learning significantly more sample efficient. This\napproach is evaluated in simulation environments such as MiniGrid, SkillHack,\nand Crafter, and on a real robot arm in block manipulation tasks.
